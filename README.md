# Lung-Disease-Detection
Applied deep learning and CNN to detecting and classified lung disease using imagery data. We used the images that belong to 4 categories : healthy, covid-19, viral pneumonia, and bacterial pneunomia. Each categories are consist of 133 images and we used it to develop model that could detect and classify the images in less than 1 minutes.

For the image dataset that i used on this project, i put it on google drive. I put label in each images categories with numbers from 0 to 3 ( 0 = covid-19, 1 = normal, 2 = viral pneumonia, 3 = bacterial pneumonia)
